                <p class="card-text">

They believe that even after working with a lot of dedication and perseverance, the pay they receive is demotivating. If you are one of those people too, you should remember that your salary structure and your take-home pay are based on what the firm offers with you having very little control. You can’t really help all those deductions, can you?
